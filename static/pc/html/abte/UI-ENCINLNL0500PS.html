						<p class="mb20">When an insurance contract is concluded, an insurance subscriber must provide true answers to the questions asked by an insurance company on an insurance application, and this is called “the duty to inform before signing a contract (duty to inform under the Commercial Act). The company collects information on the subscriber's present and past illnesses, current disability status, etc. through the questionnaire on the application form and determines whether to conclude an insurance contract. <br>
							Important matters are the matters that affect the condition of subscription and the terms of subscription, including the treatment history of diseases (eg hypertension, diabetes, etc.).<br>
							If the insurance subscriber has not fulfilled ‘the duty to inform’ before the contract, the company may terminate the contract and refuse to pay for the claim, so please check on the matters to be attended to.</p>
						
						<h4 class="hd-tit4">Matters to be attended to</h4>	
						<ul class="bullet a">
							<li><span class="t-blue">You must tell the truth for the questions on the insurance application.</span><br>
								Even if the insurance subscriber has not informed the current or past disease or current disability status because he or she believed it to be minimal, if it is an important matter affecting the condition of subscription and the terms of subscription, it will constitute as a violation of the duty to inform. <br>
								If it is unclear whether you are obliged to inform before the contract is made, it is safe to include it in the questionnaire first, and it is advisable to provide the company with the results of medical checkups and inquire whether it is important in advance. <br>
								In addition, when a company solicits for insurance by using a communication means such as a telephone, questions from a company counselor replaces the questionnaire on the application form, so you must answer the question of the counselor truthfully.</li>
							<li><span class="t-blue">Notifying the insurance planner only does not quality as fulfillment of the duty to inform before signing a contract.</span><br>
								If the insurance subscriber verbally notifies the insurance planner without responding to the questionnaire in the application form, it cannot be regarded as fulfilling the duty to inform before the contract.
								<ul class="bullet c pl10">
									<li>Generally, the insurance planner is not authorized to independently conclude an insurance contract on behalf of the insurance company or to receive the duty to inform (Supreme Court Decision, June 28, 2007, 2006 Da 69837)
										<br>Therefore, it is not enough to inform the insurance planner and you must inform through the questionnaire of the application form.</li>

							<li><span class="t-blue">Regularly manage so that the premiums are not overdue.</span><br>
								You should pay attention usually on paying the premium regularly so that the contract will not be terminated<br>
								due to overdue insurance premiums, and in recent years, insurance premiums are often automatically debited, but you need to have a habit of checking if the insurance premium is properly debited once a month to prevent overdue payment due to insufficient balance.
