					Kyobo Life Insurance established a sustainable management system in 2011 with focus on ‘humanistic management philosophy,’ which has been maintained since the foundation.
					In addition, we have been leading stakeholder-oriented sustainability management by stating the philosophy of sustainability management, ‘the pursuit of mutual growth with stakeholders,’ in the preface of Articles of Incorporation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Recent environmental changes, such as abnormal climate and digital transformation, have changed our lives. Society is in need of a new world. Companies are urged so-called ‘new Entrepreneurship,’ which considers various stakeholders surrounding a company rather than seeking profits only.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 2022, Kyobo Life Insurance has established the ESG policy, a public declaration on how to respond to each ESG issue, in order to pursue sustainable management in a sincere manner. The ESG management department will manage and monitor ESG policies continuously by cooperating with relative department.
				</p>
				<p>
					Kyobo Life Insurance will create a promising future for the next generation by actively practicing sustainable management based on the sustainability management philosophy of ‘pursuing mutual growth with all stakeholders.’

					<p>
						In tandem with its philosophy of sustainable business management that “pursues mutual growth with all stakeholders,” Kyobo Life promotes ESG management that takes into account the environmental (E), social (S) and governance (G) criteria. Kyobo Life was the first Korean insurance company to join the UN Global Compact, and is working hard to actively communicate with the stakeholders by publishing the Sustainability Report every year, sharing our sustainable business management activities and achievements.
					</p>
					<p>
						ESG awareness is growing across the globe. In particular, natural disasters caused by climate change are not only impacting our daily lives but they are also affecting the way we run our businesses. Accordingly, the international society adopted the Paris Agreement in 2016, agreeing to join efforts to stop the rise of average global temperature, and governments of numerous countries including Korea committed to achieving net zero in 2050- meaning net carbon emissions will be reduced to zero by 2050- and are introducing regulations and systems to obtain this goal.
					</p>
					<p>
						In line with such changes in the business environment, Kyobo Life is exerting efforts to contribute to a sustainable future by, for example, declaring its “coal phase-out” policy in May 2021, according to which no more investment will be made in construction of new coal power plant, and issuing KRW470 billion worth of ESG-certified hybrid securities in September 2021 for the first time as a local life insurance company.
					</p>
					<p>
						While proactively responding to the shifting business environment including climate change as a faithful manager of customers’ assets, we would like to share our sustainable investment policy that incorporates ESG in the decision-making process in order to generate stable long-term profit.
					</p>
					<p>
						We plan to comprehensively examine the risks and the opportunities our investment methodology could entail, respond to changes in business environment preemptively by considering ESG factors in our investment decision-making process, and strive to achieve responsible investment when managing our assets. Through these efforts, we will practice sustainable business management that generates robust profit for our customers and pursues mutual growth with all of our stakeholders.

					<h3 class="hd-tit3">5. Sustainable Investment Process</h3>
					<p>
						This policy applies to the investment activities conducted by Kyobo Life and shall follow the below process:
					</p>
					<ol class="list-process mt16">
						<li><span class="num">01.</span> Identification and proposal of investment opportunities</li>
						<li><span class="num">02.</span> Deliberation</li>
						<li><span class="num">03.</span> Execution</li>
						<li><span class="num">04.</span> Monitoring</li>
					</ol>
					<h4 class="hd-tit4">Identification and Proposal of Investment Opportunities</h4>
					<p>
						The Investment Team at Kyobo Life shall strive to identify and propose business and project opportunities that comply with the sustainable investment policy. The Investment Team shall make decisions on investment targets internally by considering the following:
					</p>
					<h4 class="hd-tit4">Retail lending</h4>
					<ul class="bullet a none">
						<li>To restrict financial support for purposes that go against environmental or social/public interest or for use in criminal acts</li>
					</ul>
					<h4 class="hd-tit4">Stock</h4>
					<ul class="bullet a none">
						<li>To make investments considering the impact of individual stocks on environment, society and governance</li>
					</ul>
					<h4 class="hd-tit4">Bond</h4>
					<ul class="bullet a none">
						<li>To make investments considering not only duration, yield and credit rating but also ESG factors when selecting the bonds</li>
					</ul>
					<h4 class="hd-tit4">Alternative Investment</h4>
					<ul class="bullet a">
						<li>To invest in assets or companies related with new & renewable and high-efficiency energy, and thereby contribute to smooth financing of eco-friendly businesses and innovation of relevant technologies</li>
						<li>To invest in social welfare projects related to residence, health and education and low-income bracket support projects, and thereby contribute to co-development of the society</li>
						<li>To consider potential technology development and job creation when investing in SMEs</li>
						<li>To primarily consider ESG related risk factors when considering investment</li>
					</ul>
					<h4 class="hd-tit4">Deliberation</h4>
					<p>
						The basic principle of the department responsible for deliberation is to examine the investment target against the ESG criteria according to the detailed rules for asset evaluation. The department analyzes and considers the impact of the potential investment on environment, society and governance. The subject investment must pass the Negative Screening, and will be evaluated according to the environmental (e.g. environmental regulation, use of resources), social (e.g. work environment, fair trade) and governance (e.g. stockholders’ right, investment structure) criteria.
					</p>
					<ul class="bullet a">
						<li>To evaluate and score local companies and project financing based on ESG criteria that reflects the characteristics of the respective target</li>
						<li>To assign ESG grades based on the evaluation: A (very good), B (good), C (average), D (poor), E (very poor)</li>
						<li>Possibility of investment by ESG grade: A~C- investment possible; D- selectively possible; E- investment restricted.</li>
						<li>Nevertheless, investment or line assignment may be possible to grade E with approval from the Investment Asset Deliberation Committee</li>
					</ul>
					<h4 class="hd-tit4">Execution</h4>
					<p>
						Investment is executed after going through the approval process, if the identified impact on ESG elements passes investment screening and the review of the actual implementation plan is complete.
					</p>
					<h4 class="hd-tit4">Monitoring</h4>
					<p>
						The team in charge of execution and the team in charge of follow-up conduct on-going monitoring of ESG risks and their mitigation measures regarding the investment made.

					<p>
						Kyobo Life discloses corporation tax information in the Business Report that is exhibited in the Data Analysis, Retrieval and Transfer System (DART) of Financial Supervisory Service.
